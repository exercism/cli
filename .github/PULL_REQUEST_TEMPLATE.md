## Exercism v2

**TLDR: Please open any pull-requests with the nextercism branch as the base
branch.**

Exercism is currently being completely [rebuilt from the ground up](https://github.com/exercism/v2-feedback), under the codename **Nextercism**.
This effort includes significant changes to the tooling, the cli client
especially.

Therefore there are [two versions](https://v2.exercism.io/) of the Exercism site
at the moment. These different versions are reflected in this repo by the
[master](https://github.com/exercism/go/tree/master) branch (v1), and the
[nextercism](https://github.com/exercism/go/tree/nextercism) branch (v2). **The
master branch is frozen for now, except for security or bug fixes,** and new
changes are being merged onto the nextercism branch. This means that any changes
should be made in a branch based off the nextercism branch and any pull-requests
should be made with the nextercism branch as base. See the [Github docs](https://github.com/blog/2224-change-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request) for
how to change the base branch of a pull-request.

The "nextercism" branch is our default branch, your PR should be applied to it
automatically.

If you're in any doubt please do open an issue, we're more than happy to help
with any uncertainty about this. And thankyou for contributing!! :heart: :tada:

Please delete this blurb when you open your pull-request. :smiley:
