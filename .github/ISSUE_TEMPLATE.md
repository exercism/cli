<!--
Hello. Thanks for opening an issue on Exercism - we really appreciate your interest in helping!

We are currently in a phase of our journey where we have paused community contributions to allow us to take a breather and redesign our community model. You can learn more in this blog post: https://exercism.org/blog/freeing-our-maintainers. **As such, all issues and PRs in this repository are being automatically closed.**

That doesn’t mean we’re not interested in your ideas, or that if you’re stuck on something we don’t want to help. The best place to discuss things is with our community on the Exercism Community Forum: https://forum.exercism.org. If necessary, we will open actionable issues here about what needs to change.

If you do open an issue, the auto-close comment will include a link to create a discussion on the forum.
