This command can be used for scripting, or it can be combined with shell
commands to take you to your workspace.

For example you can run:

    cd $(exercism workspace)

On Windows, this will work only with Powershell, however you would
need to be on the same drive as your workspace directory. Otherwise
nothing will happen.
