## Manual Testing against Exercism

To test your changes while doing everyday Exercism work you
can build using the following instructions. Any name may be used for the
binary (e.g. `testercism`) - by using a name other than `exercism` you
can have different profiles under `~/.config` and avoid possibly
damaging your real Exercism submissions, or test different tokens, etc.

On Unices:

- `cd /path/to/the/development/directory/cli && go build -o testercism ./exercism/main.go`
- `./testercism -h`

On Windows:

- `cd /d \path\to\the\development\directory\cli`
- `go build -o testercism.exe exercism\main.go`
- `testercism.exe â€”h`

### Releasing a new CLI version
Consult the [release documentation](RELEASE.md).
